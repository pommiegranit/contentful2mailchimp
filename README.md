Create a MailChimp campaign from a Contentful Webhook

This repository contains the basic code to take the payload from a customised Contentful webhook and to create a MailChimp campaign.

It accompanies a [blog post on the Contentful website.] https://www.contentful.com/blog/2018/11/30/mailchimp-campaign-contentful-webhooks-loose-coupling/

The coding is designed to run as an action on IBM Cloud.

Don't forget to update the config.py with your own values.
